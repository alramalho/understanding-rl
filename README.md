# Clean RL Algorithms

---- 

## Why? 
When I was trying to implement my first Reinforcement Learning algorithm, I struggled more than I wanted to make a \
paralellization between the theory and the code. First of all the theory could be rewritten in different ways, either \
with different notation or different details, sometimes even both. \
On top of this there were also tons of ready-to-use implementations in Tensorflow and Pytorch, but most of them were
honestly too much optimized and complicated, obstructing the learning by focusing on small implementation details.

This repo is for anyone relatively new to Machine/Reinforcement Learning that wants to be able to understand the \
theory and be able to easily transpose it to code.
